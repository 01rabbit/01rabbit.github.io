## About / Short Bio

I am an independent security researcher and former penetration tester who now develops security tools as a personal research endeavor. My work has been showcased at conferences including Black Hat Asia Arsenal, BSides Tokyo, SECCON, and more recently at BSides Las Vegas, Black Hat USA Arsenal, and SecTor Arsenal. All of this activity is self-funded ‚Äî which means the more I speak around the world, the more my bank account suffers. As my follower count on X rises, so does my alcohol consumption, and that‚Äôs probably the most consistent metric in my career.
