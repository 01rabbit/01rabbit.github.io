## Azazel Series — Cyber Scapegoat Gateway

- GitHub: https://github.com/01rabbit/Azazel
- Concept: “Delay to win” — deceive, contain, and buy time. Gateway that absorbs attacks and orchestrates tactical delaying actions.
- Tech: Suricata, OpenCanary, Vector, Python (Scapy), Mattermost alerts, iptables/nftables, tc.

## PAKURI Series — Pentesting Automation Frameworks

### PAKURI

![pakuri-banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01rabbit/PAKURI/master/img/pakuri-banner.png)
- GitHub: https://github.com/01rabbit/PAKURI
- Concept: “Numeric Keypad Navigation System” — transforms Kali-based tools into a fully navigable TUI controlled by just the keypad.
- Purpose: Streamlines penetration testing via intuitive, semi-automated workflows.
- Use Cases: Red/Blue team simulations, beginner training, fast prototyping.
- Recognition: Presented at Black Hat Asia Arsenal 2020.

### KaliPAKU

![KaliPAKU-banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01rabbit/KaliPAKU/main/img/KaliPAKU_logo.png)
- GitHub: https://github.com/01rabbit/KaliPAKU
- Concept: “Type-22 Karipaku” — a training-focused, keypad-navigable launcher that simplifies pentesting workflows by assigning 3–5 digit codes to Kali Linux tools.
- Purpose: Makes learning and practicing penetration testing accessible, fast, and repeatable—ideal for beginners, educators, and validation teams.
- Use Cases: Red/Blue team exercises, classroom training, skill maintenance, and attack simulation.
- Recognition: Designed to conform with NIST SP 800-115 and released in April 2023 as the PAKURI Series' “Mark-V” version.

### BOCCHI — Chat-driven Penetration Testing Bot

![BOCCHI-banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01rabbit/BOCCHI/main/images/BOCCHI_logo.png)
- GitHub: https://github.com/01rabbit/BOCCHI
- Concept: “Type-23 BOCCHI” — a Mattermost-integrated chatbot that turns natural language into operational pentest commands.
- Purpose: Democratize access to reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning through chat-based interactions.
- Use Cases: Solo pentesters, mobile-first workflows, red team support, Mattermost-based ops automation.
- Recognition: Released in December 2023 as the PAKURI Series’ “Mark-VI” model, with GPT-powered roadmap under development.

### Babbly — Voice-Guided Pentest Assistant

![Babbly-banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01rabbit/Babbly/main/images/Babbly_banner.png)
- GitHub: https://github.com/01rabbit/Babbly
- Concept: “Type-24 Babbly” — a penetration testing tool that embraces *Artificial Incompetence* to achieve safe, offline voice-guided operation.
- Purpose: Allows users to conduct tests by voice without relying on AI or constant screen interaction, making it ideal for constrained environments.
- Use Cases: Air-gapped environments, EMP-hardened zones, hands-free security ops, visually impaired support.
- Recognition: Released as the PAKURI Series' “Mark-VII” model with full Japanese voice synthesis and SOP-based test automation.

## About / Short Bio

I am an independent security researcher and former penetration tester who now develops security tools as a personal research endeavor. My work has been showcased at conferences including Black Hat Asia Arsenal, BSides Tokyo, SECCON, and more recently at BSides Las Vegas, Black Hat USA Arsenal, and SecTor Arsenal. All of this activity is self-funded — which means the more I speak around the world, the more my bank account suffers. As my follower count on X rises, so does my alcohol consumption, and that’s probably the most consistent metric in my career.
